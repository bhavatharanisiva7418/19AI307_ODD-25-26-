# Ex.No:1(A) INTRODUCTION TO JAVA PROGRAMMING, DATA TYPES, VARIABLES AND OPERATORS

## QUESTION:
Lovely enters a mystical Power Chamber with 10 doors.
Behind each door is a magic symbol that changes her power in a unique way using compound assignment operators.

She starts with an initial power value, and here's what happens at each door:

Door	Operation	Description
1	+=5	Adds 5 to the power
2	-=3	Subtracts 3
3	*=2	Multiplies power by 2
4	/=4	Divides power by 4
5	%=3	Power mod 3
6	&=7	Bitwise AND with 7
7	^=4	Bitwise XOR with 4
8	<<=1	Left shift by 1
9	>>=1	Right shift by 1
 

Input Format
One integer (initial power)

Output Format
Print the result after each door in this format:

Initial Power = <value>
After Door 1 (+= 5): <value>
After Door 2 (-= 3): <value>
...
After Door 10 (>>= 1): <value>
Final Power = <value>

For example:

Input	Result
10
Initial Power = 10
After Door 1 (+= 5): 15
After Door 2 (-= 3): 12
After Door 3 (*= 2): 24
After Door 4 (/= 4): 6
After Door 5 (%= 3): 0
After Door 6 (|= 2): 2
After Door 7 (&= 7): 2
After Door 8 (^= 4): 6
After Door 9 (<<= 1): 12
After Door 10 (>>= 1): 6
Final Power = 6

## AIM:

To write a Java program to demonstrate the use of data types, variables, and operators in Java programming.

## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the program.
2.	Read the initial power value from the user.
3.	Display the initial power.
4.	Apply compound assignment operators step-by-step.
5.	Display the power after each door operation.
6.	Print the final power value.
7.	Stop the program.


## PROGRAM:
 ```
/*
Program to implement variables and Operators using Java
Developed by: BHAVATHARANI S
RegisterNumber:212223230032
*/
import java.util.Scanner;
public class main{
    public static void main (String[] args){
        Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
        int p=sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Initial Power = " +p);
        System.out.println("After Door 1 (+= 5): "+(p+= 5));
        System.out.println("After Door 2 (-= 3): "+(p-= 3));
        System.out.println("After Door 3 (*= 2): "+(p*= 2));
        System.out.println("After Door 4 (/= 4): "+(p/= 4));
        System.out.println("After Door 5 (%= 3): "+(p%= 3));
        System.out.println("After Door 6 (|= 2): "+(p|= 2));
        System.out.println("After Door 7 (&= 7): "+(p&= 7));
        System.out.println("After Door 8 (^= 4): "+(p^= 4));
        System.out.println("After Door 9 (<<= 1): "+(p<<= 1));
        System.out.println("After Door 10 (>>= 1): "+(p>>= 1));
        System.out.println("Final Power = " +p);
    }
}
```

## RESULT:

Thus, the Java program demonstrating the use of compound assignment operators was successfully executed and the output was verified.
